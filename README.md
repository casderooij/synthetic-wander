# Synthetic wander

When Cas De Rooij first visited Woensel-West he was caught with the idea of wandering, as he believes it’s a great way to discover a new environment. The hardest part of wandering is that at every intersection you have to decide if you go left, straight ahead or to the right. To make this choice easier De Rooij gave this assignment to the computer, wrote a code in JavaScript and indexed all intersections of this area.

With this project De Rooij gives the user an insight into these processes. Although an app like Google Maps is used on a daily basis, no one has a clue how these algorithms actually work. It’s a so-called black box. To create more awareness De Rooij shows the user what decision the computer makes and why. As wandering is all about not being stuck at your phone and enjoying the surroundings, the unique route you’re getting presented is printed on a map. Now it’s up to the user if it will follow this route, or decide to head somewhere else instead.
